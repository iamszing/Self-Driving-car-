# Self-Driving-car-
A self driving simple car using Reinforcement learning and Deep-Q learning.

I have used the libraries for python 3.6.
You need to have the pytorch library

Run the following commands on you anaconda prompt to install the required libraries:
    conda install -c peterjc123 pytorch-cpu
    conda install -c conda-forge kivy
 (WINDOWS)
 
 Run the map.py file
 The screenshot shows how the output looks like. You can manually draw any path or obstacles. The yellow part is the obstacle.
 
 **The ai.py file is the readmade file that i got from https://www.superdatascience.com/artificial-intelligence/
 The szai.py file is my file
